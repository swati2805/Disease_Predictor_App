Final Project for CMPE_272 Spring 2019 by Group 18

**Team Name: Group 18**
Approved Project Idea: **Disease Prediction Application**

**Description:** Every day doctors analyse symptoms and medical records of people, that helps them to predict and treat the patients. We created a system to help doctors to accurately predict several diseases based on the large datasets of medical information available without going through huge medical records and deep analysis. The system is user friendly and lets the doctor enter general information, symptoms as well as data provided by medical reports, as a result the system predicts the disease and suggests the likeliood of a disease. As of now the system works with small but real data set, going forward we plan to inhance the dataset and also make the system self sustainable by adding the new data to the datset.
The application is also for the patients to login and have an analysis done by a bot. They interact with a chatbot who is the first point of contact and initial level of disease prediction. According to the bot's suggestion the patient can decide to actually visit a doctor or not. 

**Methodology:**

1) Train the machine for prediction of disease based on the dataset.

2) Used the training model deployment to be used for the new data entered by the doctor or the patient.

3) Display the results on the screen with details such as disease name, likelihood of diease, etc.

4) Write our own ML for enhancing the functionality and desired outputs when the dataset increases and is more refined.
